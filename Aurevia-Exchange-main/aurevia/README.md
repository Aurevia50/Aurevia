# Aurevia Exchange

Aurevia Exchange is a Next.js application using TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, NextAuth, Socket.IO, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Recharts and Lightweight Charts. Trading and market prices used by the trading engine remain internal simulations; the `/markets` dashboard separately displays live-provider quotes and history. This repository does not connect to a live broker, exchange, bank, or payment network.

## What is implemented

### User application
- Landing page, registration and credential login
- JWT sessions with USER/ADMIN role enforcement
- KYC profile submission, private identity-document uploads, and administrator review states
- Profile and account settings, including password-confirmed account deletion
- Optional authenticator settings, one-time recovery codes, and per-device session controls
- Live dashboard with cash equity and open positions
- Realtime market ticker
- Trading terminal with Market, Limit and Stop orders
- Simulated order book and realtime candles/price chart
- Open-order cancellation
- One-click position close
- Unrealized P&L display
- Wallet balance from the ledger
- Deposit and withdrawal requests
- Funding history
- Public Stories feed and fullscreen image/video viewer, available without signing in

### Administration
- Role-protected admin area
- User list and freeze/unfreeze
- Audited permanent deletion of user accounts, KYC submissions, funding requests, and support conversations
- Role-separated administrator and customer accounts; administrators cannot access customer account routes
- KYC profile and private document approval/rejection
- Per-user deposit and withdrawal enablement controls
- Deposit/withdrawal approval queue
- Deposit approval posts the exact approved amount to the user's ledger atomically
- Force-close open positions
- Instrument enable/disable and configuration API
- System settings
- Stories management with categories, private media uploads, previews, drafts, scheduling, visibility, archive/delete controls, engagement analytics, and per-story audit history
- Deleted Items recycle bin for waitlist entries, client stories, and broadcasts, with search, filtering, audited restore, and audited permanent deletion
- Audit log
- Realtime operational statistics

User account deletion permanently removes the user and related account records in a transaction, and then removes associated private uploads. Pending/approved/processing funding requests and non-zero ledger balances block self-service and ordinary administrator deletion; an administrator can explicitly force deletion. Audit entries are retained with actor/target references and metadata scrubbed where needed.

### Public Stories

The public `/stories` feed and homepage/dashboard story strips read only published, non-expired content; scheduled stories become visible when their publication time arrives. Administrators manage stories at `/admin/stories`. Default categories are installed by the additive Stories migration, and additional categories are administrator-created. Public and member-only visibility is enforced in the server-side listing and media routes. Story images and videos are stored in the private Supabase `stories` bucket and served through short-lived signed URLs only after the story's visibility and publication state are checked. Configure the existing server-only `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; never expose the service-role key to the browser. The migration creates the private bucket if absent and refuses to proceed if an existing bucket is public or too small; it does not change any other Storage bucket.

Anonymous views use a random, HTTP-only visitor cookie whose value is hashed before storage; view and external-link counts are deduplicated per story, action, and UTC day. No visitor IP address is stored for Stories analytics.

Administrators can publish external news links from `/admin/news-feed` and select the news category. These posts appear on the News page and dashboard news panels. YouTube, Vimeo, and direct MP4/WebM/OGG links display inline; other HTTPS links are presented as outbound cards because arbitrary websites may block framing or expose unsafe embedded content. Posts can be hidden from the public feeds without deleting their audit history.

### Financial engine
- PostgreSQL persistence
- Prisma transactions
- Double-entry ledger
- Ledger balance derived from entries
- Serializable transactions for financial mutations
- Atomic funding approval
- Atomic trade reservation
- Margin release and realized P&L settlement
- Trading fees
- Insufficient-funds protection
- No direct mutable customer cash balance

### Market engine
- Internal simulated instruments
- Random-walk price engine
- One-minute candles
- Automatic Limit/Stop order processing
- Socket.io market:update events
- Socket.io trade:update events
- REST market, candle and order-book endpoints

### Live market dashboard

The `/markets` page uses server-only Finnhub or Alpaca data when configured and current. When external data is unavailable, the informational market view can fall back to clearly labeled Aurevia Internal reference prices and generated reference history; it does not present those values as live provider data. Signed-in users can ask the centralized AI service to explain a quote or history source status; only the verified symbol, timeframe, source class, and provider label are sent, never prices, account records, credentials, or raw provider errors. This explanation does not create or estimate market data. Selected quotes refresh every five seconds and watchlists every 30 seconds. This informational view is separate from paper-order execution.

REAL trade quotes and portfolio marks are provider-only: the internal fallback is not eligible for REAL order submission or REAL valuation. The trade screen displays the available best bid/ask as market quotes, not as Level 2 market depth; feeds without bid/ask data report those fields as unavailable. The quote timestamp and provider are shown, stale quotes cannot be used to submit orders, and provider-confirmed execution remains authoritative.

### AI assistance scope and controls

The centralized server-side AI gateway uses OpenRouter by default, checks that the selected model is free, and can use only explicitly allowlisted free backups. Nova provides multilingual platform help and deterministic, account-mode-scoped lookups; the account-tier page offers AI explanations of the authenticated user's locally determined onboarding checklist; the learning center has a general education assistant; the portfolio page can explain asset-class concentration from user-scoped open-position aggregates and offer a trading-journal reflection from aggregated closed-position outcomes; the markets page can explain the selected watchlist using fresh Finnhub or Alpaca provider quotes only; the news page can analyze framing in the configured recent publisher-sourced articles; administrator tools provide constrained dashboard configuration, draft assistance, normalized-signal ticket-classification suggestions, integration troubleshooting, and summaries from supplied application records. Onboarding prompts contain only account mode, tier, and locally derived checklist steps; identity documents and personal profile values are not sent. REAL portfolio analysis and market analysis use only fresh external provider data; unavailable or simulated marks are excluded. Trade reflections do not send symbols or dollar outcomes to the AI provider. News sentiment is based only on locally stored active articles from enabled sources within the last seven days and is not a verified market signal. Generated analysis is not investment advice or a trading instruction. AI never changes a ledger, approves KYC or funding, changes permissions, or submits an order.

Administrators can enable or disable each registered AI service in `/admin/command-center`; changes are audited. Calls through the central service are limited to 60 requests per actor and service per process per minute, identical sanitized prompts are cached in memory for up to 30 seconds within the same actor/service scope, and request/token metadata is recorded without prompt text. These in-process limits and caches are not distributed across multiple Render instances. The gateway redacts common email, phone/account-number, payment-number, and credential patterns before sending user/assistant message content to a provider. Do not enter identity documents, secrets, or unnecessary personal information in AI prompts.

This expansion does not add voice processing, a document/OCR provider, external market-event feeds or event summaries, personalized trade recommendations, automated KYC decisions, free-form database querying, automatic ticket classification or replies, business-report scheduling, or autonomous operations. Ticket classification is a suggestion based only on locally derived keyword signals and must be applied manually by an administrator. The unimplemented capabilities require additional product workflows, verified sources, and—in some cases—separately approved external APIs. Existing Supabase, Prisma, Alpaca, Demo/Real separation, and financial authorization paths remain unchanged.

## Important scope boundary

DEMO and REAL are mutually exclusive active modes backed by separate Aurevia ledgers, balances, orders, funding requests, investments, and P/L. DEMO orders use Aurevia's internal simulator. New REAL trade orders are submitted only to Alpaca Paper Trading when paper submission is configured and enabled; there is no live-broker endpoint. Aurevia's REAL wallet remains the user-specific ledger authority, while Alpaca is a shared paper account: provider cash/equity are not user wallet funds, and only each user's confirmed, linked executions are attributed to their paper positions. REAL paper order commitments reduce that user's available trading and withdrawal balance without posting wallet debits or credits. Paper gains are not withdrawable. The optional administrator-configured Bitcoin reference address on the deposit page is display-only: Aurevia cannot receive, custody, monitor, or verify Bitcoin. Do not send cryptocurrency based on this screen. BTC withdrawals use the user's saved, encrypted Bitcoin mainnet destination; optional TXID, sender, and date/time fields are user-submitted metadata, not evidence that a transfer occurred. An administrator must separately confirm actual external processing and record the outbound TXID before a withdrawal can complete or debit the ledger. REAL BTC deposits remain subject to separate administrator review and an explicitly entered USD credit amount. Administrators can also post audited, mode-specific paper credits directly, with a printable ledger receipt. Live brokerage, payment processing, BTC custody, and automatic external money movement are not enabled. Identity eligibility remains subject to administrator review and existing per-user funding controls.

Authenticator settings are available when the server-only `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is configured. Registration and all password-based sign-ins are code-free on both recognized and new devices, including when an authenticator is configured. Enabling the optional authenticator from Settings requires a password and one valid authenticator code to confirm enrollment; TOTP replay is rejected. Legacy `twoFactorEnabled` flags are not treated as protection and are cleared by the security migration so users can configure an authenticator through Settings > Security.

Akedly V2 is used only for phone verification after sign-in in the KYC flow; it is not part of account registration. A user can create an account without a phone OTP or third-party verification provider. KYC phone verification is separate from administrator review of identity documents and tier requests. Signed Akedly results are verified against the raw request body with the Svix SDK. If a V2 result has missing or incomplete signature headers, Aurevia treats the callback body as untrusted and uses only its attempt ID to perform a server-authenticated transaction-status lookup; unsigned or incomplete event webhooks are rejected. Redirect parameters are hints, never verification evidence. The `/api/webhooks/akedly` endpoint must be configured as the pipeline's backend callback. Live provider delivery and Render configuration require controlled staging verification; repository tests do not prove provider credentials or delivery. KYC status emails use a durable outbox and generic notices; email delivery never changes KYC status. Password reset remains email-only. Customer APIs reject administrator sessions, administrator APIs use a separate role guard, and authenticated administrators are redirected to the administration console. Verified personal profile fields become read-only for two calendar months after identity approval; profile photos remain independently changeable, and users can contact support for corrections to protected identity details.

## Requirements

- Node.js >=22.13 and <23
- Docker Desktop or PostgreSQL 15+
- npm

## Project-local browser tools

From `aurevia/`, run `npm run tools:install` to install the locked application/dev dependencies and download Chromium into `tools/playwright/browsers/`. The `tools:verify` command prints the installed tool versions and local Chromium executable path, then launches Chromium headlessly. After a Codespaces rebuild, rerun `npm run tools:install`; the browser binary cache is intentionally ignored by Git and is restored by that command. A Codespace created from this repository also runs the install command automatically after container creation.

The repository devcontainer enables Docker CLI access to the Codespaces host Docker engine through the Docker-outside-of-Docker feature. Rebuild the devcontainer after changing its configuration, then verify `docker --version` and `docker compose version`. Docker Engine is supplied by the Codespaces host; it is not installed or bundled in the repository.

On Linux, if the browser launch check reports missing shared libraries, run `npm run tools:install -- --with-deps` to install Playwright's documented OS packages as well as the browser. OS libraries are installed on the host/container, not stored in the repository. Browser smoke testing requires an already-running Aurevia server with its isolated/test database available: `npm run test:browser:smoke -- http://127.0.0.1:4310`. It checks the homepage in Chromium and the application's database-backed health endpoint. `npm run test:e2e:isolated` runs the full Playwright suite against its disposable local database.

Browser binaries are not installed during `npm ci`, `npm run build`, or Render deployment. Keep `tools:install` and browser smoke/E2E commands for local development, Codespaces, or CI; this avoids adding browser binaries to production deployments.

## Isolated browser tests

Run `npm run test:e2e:isolated` with Docker available. The command starts a disposable PostgreSQL 16 container bound only to a dynamically selected loopback port, applies Prisma migrations only to that container, and removes it after the run. The container has no persistent volume; neither `DATABASE_URL` nor `DIRECT_URL` from `.env` is used for tests. `npm run test:e2e` requires explicit `AUREVIA_E2E_DATABASE_URL` and `AUREVIA_E2E_DIRECT_URL` values that point to the same local PostgreSQL database ending in `_e2e`; it refuses Supabase, Neon, and other remote hosts before fixture setup.

The isolated database bootstraps only the minimal Supabase Storage tables, private bucket metadata, and database roles required by the Storage-policy migration. The Playwright application process has Supabase URL/key configuration cleared, so file workflows fail closed and cannot access the shared Storage service. The isolated runner reserves distinct free loopback ports for the app and mock provider to avoid collisions with unrelated services. `npm run test:e2e` by itself continues to reject non-local or mismatched database URLs.

Playwright runs with one worker because integration tests share mutable database fixtures and authentication sessions. Public-route and responsive-layout checks are kept in a separate spec from the shared-fixture application suite.

## One-time account cleanup

The manual `scripts/purge-accounts.ts` cleanup is never called by build, install, or migration commands. From `aurevia/`, first run a dry run with the exact account email:

```sh
npm exec tsx -- scripts/purge-accounts.ts --keep-email=<exact-email>
```

The dry run prints masked account identifiers and changes nothing. To execute, add `--execute` and enter `DELETE ALL NON-ADMIN ACCOUNTS` at the interactive prompt:

```sh
npm exec tsx -- scripts/purge-accounts.ts --keep-email=<exact-email> --execute
```

The script aborts unless that exact email matches one non-admin user, preserves every administrator, exports the selected users and related account records to a mode-restricted JSON file in the gitignored `backups/` directory, deletes in transactional batches, and verifies that exactly one non-admin user remains. Keep the backup securely; it contains private account data.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

`.env.example` lists variable names only. Configure the values in the ignored `.env` file or your deployment's secret manager. `DATABASE_URL` is the application connection (use the Supabase pooler URL when appropriate); Prisma uses `DIRECT_URL` for migrations and introspection. Both must point to the intended Supabase Postgres database. The application does not use a browser Supabase client; database access stays on the server through Prisma.

Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` are public configuration. All other values, especially database URLs, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, administrator credentials, SMTP credentials, verification API keys, Akedly credentials, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, are server-only. Never put a Supabase service-role/secret key or Akedly credential in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable. The Data API roles `anon` and `authenticated` have no table or sequence privileges on the application's `public` schema, and row-level security is enabled for its tables; the application uses its server-side Prisma connection.

`ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are server-only administrator credentials. On the dedicated admin login form, the first sign-in using the exact configured username or email and password provisions the configured ADMIN account. The password must be at least 12 characters. An existing customer account is never promoted to administrator; configure a separate administrator email. If the configured email is unused but an administrator already exists, that existing admin record adopts the configured email and username after the configured password is verified; a second admin is not created. The seed remains available for explicit provisioning. Restart the server after changing these values.

Signup is free and creates the user and account records transactionally through `/api/register`; it does not require phone OTP, email OTP, Turnstile, Akedly, or a verification token. Successful registration signs the user in. Phone numbers entered at signup are optional profile data; phone ownership checks happen later in KYC when required for Tier 3. Requests are limited to five per IP per ten minutes and three per normalized email per hour, and a hidden honeypot rejects automated form submissions. These in-process limits are not shared across multiple app instances. Configure the complete SMTP set (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`) to deliver branded email through Brevo; port 587 uses mandatory STARTTLS. Resend is used only when SMTP is not configured; it reads `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, with `VERIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM` retained as a legacy sender setting. This shared mailer handles password recovery, support/funding messages, and KYC notices, not account signup verification. KYC outbox delivery still requires its existing migration and authenticated cron worker; email failure does not alter KYC decisions. Password reset remains email-only. REAL-mode KYC phone verification retains its existing Akedly/Termii behavior. The production URL defaults to the current Render hostname; `PORT` and `MARKET_TICK_MS` have runtime defaults.

Signup failures return a reference ID for support; unexpected server errors are logged with a redacted cause. Never share credential values, OTPs, raw provider responses, or complete personal information.

To prepare an aggregate report of legacy, long-expired unverified accounts, run `npx tsx scripts/registration-cleanup-dry-run.ts --dry-run` in an intentionally configured environment. This report is read-only, returns counts only, and has no apply mode. Review candidate account and financial-history counts before separately authorizing any production cleanup; never use it as authorization to delete permanent users or financial/audit records.

The registration endpoint returns `Retry-After` seconds when either signup quota is exhausted. Client IPs are taken from the trusted proxy's forwarded address; the honeypot is checked server-side.

Active customer accounts receive a server-generated permanent ID in the form `AEX-YYYY-XXXX-XXXX`, using a cryptographic random suffix and a database unique index. New registrations create the ID in the same transaction as the account and ledger records. The authenticated profile, dashboard, account card, receipts, and admin user management display the ID, and profile/admin update APIs do not accept changes to it. For existing accounts, first run `npx tsx scripts/aurevia-id-backfill.ts --dry-run` against the explicitly intended database and review its aggregate counts. The additive migration adds a nullable unique column without rewriting user or financial records. The controlled rollout is: separately approve the initial report and migration, apply the additive migration, deploy the ID-aware application, rerun and review the dry run, then separately approve and run `AUREVIA_ID_BACKFILL_CONFIRM=APPLY_ACTIVE_USER_IDS npx tsx scripts/aurevia-id-backfill.ts --apply`. The backfill assigns IDs only to active customer accounts, preserves existing IDs, and retains the existing database check constraint for previously email-verified records. Never run the migration, deploy, or apply command against production without separate authorization and a reviewed dry run.

For production on Render, keep `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` set to `https://aurevia-exchange-6hfi.onrender.com` until the custom domain has working DNS and verified HTTPS. Render's `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` is used as the canonical auth/public origin unless `AUREVIA_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_VERIFIED=true` explicitly opts into the verified custom domain. Production startup fails closed if `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is missing or no valid HTTPS app origin can be resolved; it never trusts an arbitrary Host header or a hard-coded fallback secret. Official support contact defaults to `aureviainvest@gmail.com` and can be overridden with `SUPPORT_EMAIL`; `COMPLAINTS_EMAIL` may be set separately. Configure these destinations separately from the SMTP credentials. When neither the complete SMTP configuration nor the existing Resend provider is available, password recovery and support/funding email delivery are unavailable; in-app tickets and notifications remain recorded.

### Vercel deployment

This repository is configured as a Next.js application in `vercel.json`. Vercel runs the App Router routes as serverless functions; it does not run `server.ts`, persistent Socket.IO connections, or the local in-process market timer. Browser market views therefore refresh over HTTP, and the protected `/api/cron/market-tick` route advances the simulated DEMO market once per minute. Use a Vercel plan that supports one-minute Cron schedules. This market is simulated; the job does not connect to a broker or funding provider.

- Framework preset: Next.js
- Install command: `npm ci`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: leave the Vercel default
- No custom start command

Configure production and preview environment variables in the Vercel project settings. Required server values are `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, and `CRON_SECRET`. Configure Supabase private-file variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) when those workflows are enabled. Add `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` before provisioning the administrator. Set the canonical HTTPS app origin explicitly in `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`; use a separate staging database and secrets for Preview deployments. Keep credentials server-only except explicitly public site/URL keys.

Use Supabase's pooled connection string for `DATABASE_URL` where appropriate and its direct PostgreSQL connection for `DIRECT_URL`. Apply reviewed Prisma migrations to the target database before promoting the deployment; the Vercel build does not run migrations or seed an administrator. Do not point Preview deployments at production customer data. Configure the private Storage buckets and restrictive policies documented above before enabling uploads.

Generate a high-entropy `CRON_SECRET` and store it in Vercel project settings. Vercel Cron sends it as a Bearer token to the market-tick route; calls without that exact secret are rejected. Cron jobs run for production deployments. Local development and the Render Node service continue to use the custom server's ticker; Render remains the option when persistent Socket.IO/WebSocket delivery is required.

### Render deployment

Use a Render **Node web service** connected to the existing GitHub repository. Set its Root Directory to `aurevia` (the app and `package.json` are in that repository subdirectory). Render's persistent web service supports this custom Next.js/Socket.IO HTTP server and WebSocket upgrades; do not deploy it as a static site or serverless function. Keep the service on an always-on plan (the Blueprint uses `starter`); a sleeping/free instance cannot guarantee continuous market updates or WebSocket delivery. The in-process simulated-market ticker runs while the server is running, and the optional external quote broadcaster polls configured providers every 30 seconds. Selecting or upgrading the Render plan is a dashboard/billing action, not something a Git push or application environment variable can do. Signing out only ends the user's session and does not stop an always-on server. Use one instance while the in-process Socket.IO market engine is enabled; horizontal scaling requires a shared Socket.IO adapter and coordinated market worker, which are not currently configured.

#### Route production deployments through Render

The repository-root GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-render.yml` triggers the Render deploy hook on every push to `main` and can also be run manually from the Actions tab on `main`. In **GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add the repository secret `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` with the full Render deploy-hook URL. Keep the URL out of source files and logs. Disable Render's native **Auto-Deploy** for the service to avoid deploying the same push twice. The Render service must remain connected to this repository and configured with the correct production branch and Root Directory.

The internal DEMO market tick defaults to once per second (`MARKET_TICK_MS=1000`, minimum 1000 ms) and streams each update to connected chart clients. DEMO/reference charts sample a new forming candle each second and load up to 500 historical candles where available. Provider-backed charts only change when provider quote or history data arrives; the app does not invent live-market price movements. Vercel's serverless deployment does not run the in-process timer or persistent WebSocket server; its scheduled DEMO tick runs at the configured Cron cadence.

- Build command: `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- If Render reports a build command of `yarn`, update the service's Build Command in **Settings → Build & Deploy** to the command above. Installing dependencies alone does not generate the `.next` production build required by the start command.
- Docker is not required for Render's native Node runtime. The checked-in multi-stage `Dockerfile` is an alternative if the Render service is explicitly configured as a Docker service.

Configure these variables in Render's environment settings (secrets stay in Render, never in source). A local `.env` file is not automatically uploaded to Render:

- Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Required for browser push: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` (for example `mailto:aureviainvest@gmail.com`), `PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 random bytes encoded as Base64), and `PUSH_DELIVERY_CRON_SECRET`. Generate a VAPID pair with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`; set its public and private values in the correspondingly named Render variables, and never commit the private key. Generate the encryption and cron secrets with `openssl rand -base64 32` and `openssl rand -hex 32`, respectively. Keep the VAPID private key, encryption key and cron secret server-only. Back up the encryption key securely and retain it: changing it makes existing stored subscriptions undecryptable.
- Required to enable authenticator-based two-factor authentication: `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, a stable 32-byte Base64 key generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`. Store it only in the server's secret manager and back it up securely. Do not rotate or lose it without a planned re-enrollment process; enrolled TOTP secrets cannot be decrypted without the original key. Two-factor enrollment remains unavailable until this key is configured. Password changes, session revocation, and REAL withdrawal requests require the current password but do not require a separate verification code. Security sessions are persisted and individually revocable; location is not displayed because reliable location data is not collected.
- Required for administrator sign-in: `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Use the exact configured username or email and password at `/admin/login`; first sign-in provisions the admin or adopts the existing admin record when the configured email is unused. SMTP/support variables and `MARKET_TICK_MS` are optional for application startup; configure `SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com`, `SMTP_PORT=587`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, and `SMTP_FROM` to use Brevo over STARTTLS for outbound mail. The user/password/from values must be supplied through Render's environment settings and never committed. The existing Resend configuration is used only when SMTP is absent. New registrations require phone ownership verification before a permanent account is created; email remains the contact for KYC updates and password recovery. Identity status is administrator-reviewed; it does not indicate external identity verification.
- Optional external market data: configure `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` (or legacy `ALPACA_API_SECRET`), and `ALPACA_TRADING_BASE_URL` (or legacy `ALPACA_BASE_URL`) for primary Alpaca IEX stock history, with `FINNHUB_API_KEY` as the configured fallback. The Alpaca base URL must be the approved paper Trading API host even when used for read-only data. Finnhub also supplies quotes and supported non-stock history. The application keeps live quotes separate from historical candles and labels internal reference data; real-mode charts never substitute demo or internal candles. Historical coverage, IEX access, and quote availability depend on provider plans and supported symbols.
- Optional REAL-mode Alpaca Paper order submission: configure `ALPACA_PROVIDER=alpaca`, `ALPACA_TRADING_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2` (the paper endpoint is also the default), `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` (or the supported legacy `ALPACA_API_SECRET`), and `ALPACA_PAPER_ORDERS_ENABLED=true` as server-side settings. Keep `REAL_EXECUTION_ENABLED=false`. The adapter rejects live and non-Alpaca endpoints. Without credentials or the enable flag, REAL orders fail with a configuration status instead of falling back to simulated execution. Never use paper account cash or equity as Aurevia user wallet funds.
- Optional AI assistance: set server-only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; `AI_PROVIDER` defaults to `openrouter` and `AI_MODEL` defaults to `openrouter/free`. The gateway rejects OpenRouter models unless the provider reports zero prompt and completion pricing. Gemini and Groq backups are opt-in through `AI_BACKUP_PROVIDERS` and require explicit `AI_FREE_MODEL_ALLOWLIST`, `GEMINI_FREE_MODEL`, or `GROQ_FREE_MODEL` entries; verify provider pricing/free-tier terms before allowlisting. Provider/model failures never route to an unapproved or paid model. `DEMO_AI_ENABLED=true` enables DEMO recommendations only; recommendations require fresh internal DEMO data and never place orders. Users must review and submit orders through the existing authorized workflow.
- The administrator-only **AI & API command center** at `/admin/command-center` runs read-only provider checks and records redacted health/usage metadata. To submit AI credentials through its approval queue, configure `AI_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as a stable 32-byte Base64 secret (`openssl rand -base64 32`). A second administrator must approve a submitted credential. Environment variables take precedence; Render deployment secrets remain managed in Render. If the encryption key is unavailable, configure credentials directly in Render rather than submitting them in-app.

Set both `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the same canonical HTTPS origin assigned to the Render service (or its verified custom domain). The database URLs must be the existing Supabase PostgreSQL connections; use Supabase's pooler for application traffic where appropriate and its direct connection for Prisma schema management. Render injects these environment variables during the build. Keep production migrations out of the build command: first reconcile the target database's migration history with the checked-in migrations, review the migration plan for compatibility with the running release, and obtain explicit approval before applying migrations using `DIRECT_URL`. Confirm migration status and take appropriate database backups before any approved production migration; do not use `db:push` or reset commands in production.

#### Account theme preference deployment

The two account themes are stored on the existing `User` record and are shared by that account across devices. The additive migration `prisma/migrations/20261105191504_account_theme_preference/migration.sql` adds the constrained `ApplicationTheme` enum and a non-null `preferredTheme` column defaulting existing accounts to `FOREST_GREEN`. Before deploying code that reads or writes this field, reconcile this migration with the target database's actual Prisma migration history (which has previously diverged), review and back up the target database, and obtain explicit approval. Apply it only as a deliberate, separately authorized one-off migration using the existing production migration process; do not run it during a build or deploy. Do not use `db:push`, reset, or destructive schema synchronization. The migration has not been applied to production by this change.

#### Browser push notification deployment

1. In **Render → Aurevia web service → Environment**, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT`, `PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `PUSH_DELIVERY_CRON_SECRET`. Generate a fresh VAPID pair locally using `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`; store its public output in `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` and its private output in `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`. Set `VAPID_SUBJECT` to a valid contact URI such as `mailto:aureviainvest@gmail.com`. Generate separate values for the encryption and worker secrets using `openssl rand -base64 32` and `openssl rand -hex 32`; do not reuse the VAPID private key for encryption.
2. Review additive migrations `prisma/migrations/20261025153000_browser_push_notifications/migration.sql`, `prisma/migrations/20261102173000_kyc_email_outbox/migration.sql`, and `prisma/migrations/20261104110000_registration_phone_lookup/migration.sql` against the target database's actual Prisma migration history and data. The registration migration adds the phone lookup index used during signup. This checkout's production migration history has previously shown divergence; reconcile it with the database owner, take a backup, and approve the migration plan before applying it. Do not run `db:push`, reset, or an unreviewed migration on production. After reconciliation and approval, run `npm run db:migrate` against the production service's `DIRECT_URL` as a deliberate one-off operation, not in the build command.
   The KYC email worker also requires the additive `prisma/migrations/20261102173000_kyc_email_outbox/migration.sql` migration. Review and apply it under the same schema-reconciliation, backup, and authorization process before deploying code that enqueues KYC email events.
3. Deploy the existing Node web service over its canonical HTTPS origin. The service serves `/sw.js` at origin scope and must be reachable at `https://<your-domain>/sw.js`.
4. In **Render → New → Cron Job**, connect the same repository, set Root Directory to `aurevia`, Build Command to `npm ci --include=dev`, and Command to `node scripts/push-delivery-cron.mjs`. Add `PUSH_DELIVERY_WORKER_URL=https://<your-domain>/api/cron/push-delivery`, the same `NEXTAUTH_URL` as the web service, the web service's `PUSH_DELIVERY_CRON_SECRET`, and the web service's `CRON_SECRET`. Set the schedule to every minute (`* * * * *`) and save. The job calls the authenticated same-origin workers for push delivery and KYC email delivery; push and email events are persisted/retried.
5. After both services are deployed, sign in using a supported HTTPS browser, open **Settings → Preferences**, enable notifications, grant permission from that button, and send a test notification. Verify that the test arrives and that clicking it opens the account page. Actual offline delivery must be verified on each supported browser/device; it is not guaranteed across unsupported browsers, disabled permissions, operating-system focus modes, or push-service outages.

Foreground notification sounds are configured separately in **Settings → Preferences** and saved locally per signed-in account on each device; no database migration is required. Audio must be enabled or previewed through a user interaction, and sounds play only for newly received notifications while the app is visible. iOS Safari and other browsers may impose additional audio restrictions, so validate on each supported device. When the app is closed or backgrounded, no custom sound is promised; browser push sounds remain controlled by the operating system and browser.

The development command uses `.next-dev` so it does not collide with production builds in `.next`; `server.ts` loads the repository `.env` and honors the configured database URLs. The Docker build context excludes `.env*`; supply runtime configuration only through the hosting environment. The application has no production localhost URL dependency: its localhost URL fallback is for local development, and production startup requires `NEXTAUTH_URL`.

### Simulated account workflows and external provider readiness

DEMO customer orders use Aurevia's internal simulator, and REAL trade orders use the paper-only Alpaca adapter when enabled. Every order, execution, and position remains associated with the authenticated Aurevia user and REAL account; confirmed fills are reconciled idempotently and paper orders never post to the wallet ledger. The adapter checks user-specific collateral from the Aurevia ledger, filled paper cost basis, open buy reservations, and pending withdrawals. It does not import the shared Alpaca cash or equity into any user's balance. When the initial provider submission has an ambiguous result, the service looks up the deterministic client order ID and does not blindly submit again. Admins can manually reconcile an unresolved order from the admin operations panel; the endpoint requires an authenticated administrator and verifies the order/user association. REAL BTC deposits still require user evidence and separate manual verification before an audited USD ledger credit. The application does not verify Bitcoin confirmations or provide a receiving address. REAL withdrawal eligibility excludes pending withdrawals and paper-trading commitments; administrator-confirmed external processing is still required to complete a withdrawal. Historical investment allocations and target returns remain subject to their existing simulated settlement behavior; they do not represent Alpaca funds or paper-trading profits. No live brokerage, custody, or automatic external payout is enabled.

DEMO customer actions include viewing supported markets, placing simulated orders, allocating virtual funds to admin-published DEMO-eligible investment opportunities, reviewing practice activity, and resetting the virtual account. DEMO funding, withdrawals, cards, and KYC submissions remain disabled in server-side routes as well as the interface. Investment allocations may be made across available opportunities, reserve only the user's separate DEMO ledger balance, and use simulated settlement terms; any target earnings are estimates, not guaranteed returns or external investments. New DEMO ledgers start at exactly USD 5,000; reset returns virtual cash to its recorded starting amount, closes open positions, cancels open orders and unsettled DEMO investments, audits the operation, and retains historical ledger entries. AI trade ideas are server-generated recommendations only: the user must review and submit an order, and the order service independently validates active mode, fresh prices, cash, exposure, fees, and slippage. AI recommendations are disabled by default; enable them with `DEMO_AI_ENABLED=true` only when the central server-side AI gateway has an approved free model configured. The `DEMO_AI_*` values in `.env.example` control strategy selection, supported symbols, risk sizing, thresholds, simulated costs, and the evaluation interval. No provider key belongs in a browser-visible variable.

### Activity visibility and retention

The account Activity page supports search, category/status/date filters, pagination, archive/restore, removal from the visible feed, and clear-history actions. These actions create mode-scoped visibility preferences and do not erase or alter orders, positions, investments, funding requests, ledger entries, balances, or audit history. Open orders and positions cannot be archived or removed from the feed. Read notifications can be permanently deleted only when they have no push-delivery record; notification deletion does not delete the related account record. The administrator Activity Management page is role-checked server-side, scopes every action to a selected user and account mode, and writes administrative outcomes to the protected audit log. Admin login history is excluded from the default activity results and is shown only when the Login history filter is explicitly selected; login and audit records remain immutable. Per-row removal icons hide eligible activity from that user's feed without confirmation because the action is reversible; bulk clear/remove and permanent deletion still require confirmation.

The additive `20261027083000_activity_visibility_management` migration adds notification archive timestamps and the activity visibility preference table. It does not reset or rewrite existing account data. Apply it through the normal reviewed deployment migration process before deploying the application version that uses these fields.

The current provider interfaces describe broker order submission/cancellation/status, balances/positions, reconciliation, quotes/bars, funding confirmations, identity/sanctions checks, and webhook signature verification. The admin-only `/api/admin/providers/status` endpoint performs a read-only `GET /v2/account` check and reports configuration, connectivity, and sanitized provider errors without returning credentials. Alpaca paper account details are visible only to admins and are not Aurevia balances or ledger funds. REAL-side orders persist provider references and reconcile confirmed fill deltas into user-attributed paper positions; the wallet ledger is not posted from paper fills. DEMO orders remain entirely internal. The paper-order adapter is hard-limited to Alpaca's paper endpoint; `REAL_EXECUTION_ENABLED` remains false and does not enable live execution. The additive migration `20261027100000_alpaca_paper_execution_reconciliation` adds provider order/execution state and must be reviewed and applied through the existing migration process before deployment; it has not been applied by this work.

Server-only Alpaca configuration recognizes `ALPACA_API_KEY`, `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` (preferred) or `ALPACA_API_SECRET` (backward-compatible secret alias), `ALPACA_TRADING_BASE_URL` (preferred) or `ALPACA_BASE_URL` (backward-compatible URL alias), and `ALPACA_PROVIDER`. The individual trading adapter accepts only `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets` (optionally with `/v2`); invalid or live endpoints are rejected. `ALPACA_PAPER_ORDERS_ENABLED` is a separate, default-off toggle for paper orders. `REAL_EXECUTION_ENABLED` does not enable live brokerage execution and must remain false. Alpaca credentials are server-only, never returned to browsers or emitted in logs; the administrator provider check uses a read-only paper-account request. Payment-provider names are `PAYMENT_PROVIDER`, `PAYMENT_API_URL`, `PAYMENT_API_KEY`, and `PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`; external payment processing remains disabled. Select jurisdictions and obtain legal/compliance approval before evaluating broker, payment, market-data, and identity/AML providers. Administrators can grant simulated credits to configured REAL ledgers. A REAL BTC request is only a report of an asserted transfer: an administrator must independently inspect it and choose a USD credit amount; no blockchain verification or exchange-rate conversion is automated. The product does not provide a REAL BTC destination, so configure and operationally verify any actual receiving wallet and confirmation process outside this feature before soliciting transfers. Admin allocations update only the internal ledger; no payment, transfer, bank/card activity, or custody occurs. REAL withdrawal approval leaves funds reserved and incomplete; no external payout provider is configured, and the settlement endpoint refuses to mark REAL withdrawals complete. REAL investment requests can be reserved, reviewed, activated, completed, and settled only as simulated ledger activity; settlement returns reserved principal and does not credit configured target estimates as earnings. These actions do not create an external investment or return. Manual KYC status is explicitly an administrator review and is not external identity/AML or regulatory verification.

Private file workflows require server-only `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. The key must never be placed in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variable or imported into client components. Configure these existing private buckets (the application does not create buckets): `kyc-documents` (10 MB), `profile-avatars` (5 MB), `wallet-receipts` (10 MB), and `support-attachments` (10 MB). Their restrictive `storage.objects` RLS policies are `aurevia_kyc_documents_block_client_access`, `aurevia_profile_avatars_block_client_access`, `aurevia_wallet_receipts_block_client_access`, and `aurevia_support_attachments_block_client_access`; each blocks all operations by `anon` and `authenticated` for its bucket. Trusted server routes use the service role only after session, record-ownership, or administrator checks. New object keys use `<userId>/<generated-UUID>.<extension>`. Upload routes verify signatures, MIME type, extension, size, and owning database record; file replacement is non-upserting and owner-scoped. File access uses signed URLs for at most five minutes. Users can retrieve their own KYC documents through the owner-filtered document route; administrator KYC review requires `requireAdmin`. KYC accepts JPEG, PNG, WebP, and PDF up to 8 MB; administrators can review uploaded files from `/admin`. No external identity, AML, sanctions, or malware-scanning provider is connected.

### Provider status and safe fallbacks

| Capability | Provider/configuration | Current behavior without provider |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | Supabase Postgres; `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL` | Server operations fail explicitly; no in-memory financial fallback |
| Market information | Finnhub or Alpaca when configured and responsive; Aurevia Internal simulated reference data otherwise | The market screen shows `Market data: Live` only for current provider quotes and `Market data: Internal reference` for fallback prices and reference history |
| Display currency | Finnhub exchange quotes when available; last known database rate, then an internal reference-rate table | Approximate display conversion only; source and stale/internal status are disclosed; ledger values are never converted |
| Broker/execution | Aurevia internal simulated execution for each mode, with ledger and position isolation | Customer orders do not reach an external broker; live execution disabled |
| Deposits and withdrawals | Funding-provider contract only; no bank, card, blockchain, or custody adapter | REAL BTC credits require separate manual verification and approval; withdrawals are capped to verified BTC-funded balance and remain incomplete without a payout provider |
| Investments | No investment execution/settlement provider | Allocations reserve internal funds; settlement returns reserved principal only and never converts an estimated target return into earnings |
| Identity/KYC | No identity verification provider configured | Documents/details can be submitted for human review only; approval is an administrator decision |
| Email/OTP | New registrations require Akedly V2 (`AKEDLY_ENABLED=true` and all six server-side values) and a valid phone number. Brevo SMTP is the primary shared outbound email provider; the existing Resend integration remains a compatibility fallback when SMTP is absent. Email challenges, password recovery, support/funding messages, and KYC notices use the shared mailer; KYC notices use the existing durable outbox. | If Akedly is unavailable, new registrations stay temporary and can retry; signup never falls back to email. Email-code fallback and legacy Akedly email attempts remain for recoverable email challenges. KYC notices retry independently of the administrator decision. SMTP acceptance does not prove inbox delivery; WhatsApp/SMS channel routing depends on the configured Akedly pipeline. |
| Private files | Supabase Storage URL, private bucket, service-role key | Upload and signed access fail closed; no public-file fallback |
| Deployment | No deployment provider configuration is checked into this repository | Production secret injection, domains, TLS, backups, monitoring, and release controls must be configured in the hosting environment |
| SMS/OTP | Akedly V2 is primary when configured; Termii Send Token/Verify Token is the fallback when Akedly is unavailable or the user requests SMS instead | REAL-mode KYC phone verification uses the configured provider; users can switch from the Akedly widget to a six-digit SMS code when Termii is configured; browser redirects alone do not verify a number |

Set the following server-side environment variables for Akedly V2 (all six values are server-only). The pipeline backend callback URL must be `https://<application-host>/api/webhooks/akedly`. For example:

```dotenv
AKEDLY_API_KEY=
AKEDLY_PIPELINE_ID=
AKEDLY_WIDGET_ID=
AKEDLY_PUBLIC_KEY=
AKEDLY_WIDGET_SECRET=
AKEDLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://aureviaexchanged.dpdns.org
# Optional fallback for REAL-mode phone verification when Akedly is unavailable or the user requests SMS instead.
# Twilio Verify is preferred for SMS when all three credentials are configured. Enable the required destination countries in Twilio.
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=
# Optional Termii fallback; use your account-specific HTTPS base URL.
TERMII_API_KEY=
TERMII_SENDER_ID=
# Set this to the account-specific HTTPS base URL shown in your Termii dashboard.
TERMII_BASE_URL=https://api.ng.termii.com
```

The international SMS fallback uses [Twilio Verify](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api/verification) when `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID` are configured. Twilio requires E.164 destinations, a Verify Service, and enabled geographic permissions; country delivery depends on the provider's country support and account configuration, not every number worldwide. Codes are verified with Twilio's [Verification Check](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api/verification-check) before marking a phone as verified. Credentials are sent only to Twilio's fixed HTTPS Verify API host. The optional Termii SMS provider uses the account-specific HTTPS base URL from the [Termii developer documentation](https://developers.termii.com/), which says each account has its own base URL in the Termii dashboard. `TERMII_BASE_URL` is restricted to HTTPS hosts on the official `termii.com` domain family; it defaults to `https://api.ng.termii.com`. Twilio is preferred when fully configured; Termii is used otherwise or can be explicitly selected. Provider diagnostics log a request reference, stage, and HTTP status without credentials, phone numbers, OTPs, or provider response bodies. Password recovery uses Resend as a fallback if configured SMTP delivery fails; both messages carry the same single-use reset link.

The official integration contracts are documented at [Akedly V2 create attempt](https://docs.akedly.io/authentication/v2/start), [widget client](https://docs.akedly.io/authentication/v2/client), [result callbacks](https://docs.akedly.io/authentication/v2/results), [webhook signing and delivery](https://docs.akedly.io/webhooks), and [transaction status lookup](https://docs.akedly.io/authentication/transaction-status). The Svix package verifies raw-body webhook signatures. Configure the Akedly pipeline's backend callback to the route above and verify WhatsApp/SMS availability, country coverage, and callback receipt in staging before relying on registration verification in production. Set Render environment values as raw values, not `.env` assignment syntax: the enable flag accepts `true` (including matching surrounding quotes), while quote-wrapped provider credentials are rejected and diagnosed by variable name only. New registration signs and verifies the E.164 phone address with Akedly; it does not use email delivery as a fallback. Previously started email challenges remain recoverable. KYC email events are generic, contain no submitted identity details or administrator notes, and cannot change the review decision. Password reset remains email-only.

For `POST /api/v1/widget-sdk/create-attempt`, the phone HMAC is HMAC-SHA256 over compact UTF-8 JSON with keys in exactly this order: `apiKey`, `publicKey`, `timestamp`, `phoneNumber`; `timestamp` is Unix milliseconds and must be within 60 seconds of Akedly's clock. Encode the digest as lowercase hexadecimal. Use `AKEDLY_WIDGET_SECRET` as the HMAC key—not `AKEDLY_API_KEY` or `AKEDLY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`—and put the phone in the signed message exactly as it appears in `verificationAddress.phoneNumber`. The API key, public key, and phone remain in the request body as documented. Set all provider values without surrounding whitespace, control characters, or quote wrapping; configuration checks report affected variable names only.

Password recovery tokens are random, single-use, expire after 30 minutes, and are stored only as SHA-256 hashes. Resetting a password revokes the active account session. Successful and failed credential attempts are written to the existing admin-only audit log with a validated IP when available, bounded user-agent text, and a hashed identifier for unknown accounts; no password or raw token is stored.

For a real deployment, use a unique high-entropy `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, a strong administrator password, and managed secret storage.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# For the local Postgres container, set DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL to its connection URL.
docker compose up -d postgres
npx prisma generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

The application server owns the HTTP server and Socket.io endpoint, so use `npm run dev` rather than `next dev` when realtime functionality is required.

## Administrator provisioning

```text
Username: configured with ADMIN_USERNAME
Email: configured with ADMIN_EMAIL
Password: configured with ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

Set `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and a unique, strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the deployment secret manager or an ignored local `.env` file. No administrator password is included in the repository. On a fresh database, use those exact credentials at `/admin/login`; first sign-in provisions the ADMIN account. If an admin already exists and the configured email is unused, first sign-in updates that existing admin record to the configured identity rather than creating a second one. Alternatively, run `npm run db:seed` to provision explicitly.

The admin **Account sessions** page (`/admin/sessions`) displays recent registered-account sign-ins and allows an administrator to revoke an active session. It reuses the existing login audit records and current-session marker; it does not collect anonymous browsing activity, expose IP addresses or raw user-agent strings, resolve location, or issue arbitrary commands to a visitor's device. Passwords remain one-way hashed and can only be changed through the account recovery flow.

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The included compose file starts PostgreSQL and the app. It requires the database, NextAuth, and administrator values from `.env`; it contains no default credentials.

## Test workflow

### 1. Health

Open:

```text
GET /api/health
```

Expected response includes `ok: true` and `database: "ok"`.

### 2. Admin login

Open `/login` and use the configured administrator credentials. `/admin` must be accessible only to an ADMIN JWT.

### 3. User registration

Create a normal account from `/register`, sign in, and confirm `/dashboard`, `/trade`, `/wallet`, `/kyc` and `/settings` are protected routes.

### 4. Identity review

Submit the profile and identity documents for private administrator review. Tier 3 is granted only after an authorized administrator approves the request. This is an internal review, not external identity, bank, broker, government, or regulatory verification; simulated account access is separate from identity status.

### 5. Simulated funding

From `/wallet`, deposit requests remain internal and pending administrator review; the optional configured Bitcoin address is display-only and does not receive or verify funds. Administrators can fund a selected user/mode directly; that action creates an audited ledger entry and printable receipt. DEMO withdrawals are simulated; an authorized administrator can complete a virtual debit. REAL BTC withdrawal requests use a saved, encrypted Bitcoin mainnet destination and may include optional user-reported TXID/sender/date-time details. Those details are not verified; actual outbound transaction confirmation and the processing TXID remain administrator responsibilities. REAL withdrawal requests are limited to the available eligible balance; admin approval reserves the request but does not complete it. No external payout provider is configured, so REAL withdrawals remain incomplete and no money is paid. Rejection or cancellation releases a reservation. No bank, card, custody wallet, or payout provider is connected.

New DEMO accounts start with a one-time $5,000 virtual USD balance; REAL accounts start at $0.00. Each opening amount is kept in its corresponding double-entry ledger, and no DEMO balance is transferred into REAL. Account-mode balances, orders, positions, transactions, and P&L remain isolated. Administrators may issue audited credits to either account mode. The `/admin/markets` page can generate bounded, audited price changes for supported paper instruments; it does not publish live quotes. Users can select a persistent display currency across wallet, dashboard, portfolio, activity, and USD transaction history; conversions are informational only and never change underlying ledger balances.

### 6. Trading

After initializing a DEMO account or approving a simulated deposit request:

1. Open `/trade`.
2. Select an instrument.
3. Place a Market order.
4. Confirm an execution and position appear.
5. Watch the price update through Socket.io.
6. Confirm unrealized P&L changes.
7. Close the position.
8. Confirm margin plus realized P&L is returned to the user ledger.

For Limit and Stop orders, place an order outside the current trigger price, then wait for the market simulator to reach its trigger. The server processes eligible open orders on market ticks.

### 7. Ledger invariant

Every posted monetary transaction contains exactly one debit and one credit for the same amount. The test suite also covers positive monetary quantities.

### 8. Admin controls

From `/admin`, test:

- Freeze/unfreeze a user
- Approve/reject KYC
- Change USER/ADMIN role
- Approve/reject funding
- Reject historical DEMO funding requests; release only stale DEMO withdrawal reservations
- Force-close positions
- Enable/disable instruments
- Generate audited SIMULATED price ticks from `/admin/markets`

Client stories are private drafts until an administrator links and verifies the client, records a completed REAL withdrawal with its settlement reference, records publication consent, and approves the story. The repository does not include the supplied story photos or a configured image-storage provider, so seeded drafts have no image reference. No story, financial amount, or verification badge is published by seeding.
- Change system settings
- Inspect audit logs

### 9. API checks

Useful endpoints:

```text
GET  /api/health
GET  /api/market
GET  /api/candles?instrumentId=<id>&limit=100
GET  /api/orderbook?instrumentId=<id>
GET  /api/orders
POST /api/orders
DELETE /api/orders
GET  /api/positions
POST /api/positions
GET  /api/wallet
POST /api/wallet
GET  /api/kyc
POST /api/kyc
```

## Production hardening checklist

Before any real-money use, add and independently verify:

- Managed PostgreSQL with backups and point-in-time recovery
- Distributed rate limiting for remaining process-local application limits (authentication verification uses atomic database-backed limits)
- Optional WebAuthn/passkey sign-in (the compatible packages are installed but passkeys are not enabled)
- Email/phone verification
- Independent KYC verification provider and document malware scanning
- AML and sanctions screening
- Real payment/custody integrations
- External market-data and execution integrations
- Reconciliation jobs
- Idempotency keys for every financial POST operation
- CSRF/origin controls appropriate to the deployment topology
- Structured security logging and alerting
- Secrets manager
- WAF/DDoS controls
- Database connection pooling
- Penetration testing
- Dependency/SBOM scanning
- Disaster recovery testing
- Regulatory review for every operating jurisdiction

## Final implemented application surface

The current source includes:

- Dedicated `/admin/login` administrator entry point with role enforcement.
- Realtime Socket.io market ticks and execution broadcasts.
- Synthetic depth/order-book endpoint at `/api/orderbook`.
- Historical candle endpoint at `/api/candles`.
- User ledger transaction endpoint at `/api/ledger`.
- Full order retrieval and cancellation API.
- Market, limit and stop order triggering.
- Serializable order execution and leverage-aware margin reservation.
- Trading-fee ledger postings.
- Open-position unrealized P&L on the dashboard and trading terminal.
- Pending-withdrawal balance reservation checks.
- Admin instrument creation, enable/disable, price and leverage editing.
- Admin self-protection against freezing or demoting the currently logged-in administrator.
- Global loading, error and not-found UI states.
- Health endpoint suitable for container/load-balancer checks.

## Verification evidence

Run verification from `aurevia/` with `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run tools:verify`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e:isolated`. The E2E runner provisions and removes a disposable loopback-only PostgreSQL database; it clears shared database and Supabase credentials before starting the application. Chromium binaries are restored by `npm run tools:install` and remain ignored by Git.

This verification does not clear production for release. The last read-only migration-status check found `20261019103000_alpaca_paper_order_account` and `20261019120000_btc_funding_and_paper_buying_power` unapplied in the configured database, while its history recorded `20261013110000_payment_method_network`, which is absent from this checkout and Git history. Reconcile that history with the database owner and review existing BTC transaction references for duplicates before considering the partial unique index; do not mark migrations applied or run SQL until the intended migration contents and production data are verified and an authorized migration plan is approved. The additional additive migration `20261027100000_alpaca_paper_execution_reconciliation` was not applied. Alpaca Paper account retrieval and order submission have not been verified with configured credentials; keep paper submission disabled until credentials, enablement, migration status, and an isolated end-to-end paper test are confirmed. Live execution remains disabled.

For local development only, point `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` at a disposable local database before running database setup commands. Never run migrations or database reset/push commands against production without an explicitly reviewed migration plan and authorization.

```bash
npm ci
npx prisma generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This remains a simulated/internal trading and accounting platform. It is not, by itself, a licensed real-money brokerage, payment processor, custodian, KYC provider, or external execution venue.

## Aurevia stability and UX upgrade (2026-09)

This revision incorporates the recurring issues identified during the Aurevia deployment journey:

- Explicit client-side registration/login actions prevent the browser's native form GET from racing React hydration.
- Registration and login now expose network/API failures instead of silently stalling.
- Authentication keeps the existing NextAuth JWT session model; logout returns to `/login` without invalidating a valid session on ordinary refresh.
- A single startup shell provides an 8-second first-entry animation and a 3-second transition for subsequent route changes. It uses session storage to avoid an endless loading loop.
- The loading UI is finite and deterministic; there is no perpetual page reload or blinking redirect loop.
- Mobile navigation is full-width, touch-friendly, and avoids desktop side gutters/zoom-style layouts.
- The Aurevia metallic gold emblem supplied in the project assets is included at `public/aurevia-logo.png` and used in startup, navigation, login, registration, and the landing page.
- The interface uses a forest-green/black/gold visual system and broker-style trading cards, market views, order ticket, positions, notifications, KYC and account controls.
- The Stanbic IBTC E-Trade page was used only as a UX/functionality reference: mobile/web trading, live market data, account control, order workflows, portfolio visibility and trade notifications. Proprietary logos, copy, artwork and source code are not copied.

### Regression checklist

1. First visit: startup overlay completes once in 8 seconds.
2. Internal navigation: transition completes in 3 seconds.
3. Browser refresh: session is not deliberately cleared.
4. Logout: returns to login and does not trigger an infinite startup/redirect loop.
5. Registration: no native `/register?` submission; request goes to `/api/register` only after the user presses Continue.
6. Login: failed authentication shows an error and does not silently hang.
7. Mobile: navigation opens as an overlay and content remains within the viewport.
8. Branding: supplied Aurevia logo is loaded from the app's public assets.
# Optional market-data providers

The market-data adapters use the providers' documented HTTPS APIs through the application's existing server-side `fetch` pattern; no additional provider SDKs are needed. Finnhub and Alpaca continue to work as before. Optional fallback adapters are available for Twelve Data (stocks, forex, and crypto), Alpha Vantage (stocks), and Financial Modeling Prep (stocks). Unsupported instrument categories are not sent to these providers; exchange indices continue to use existing providers or the internal reference feed.

Add provider API keys only as server environment variables. In Render, open **Dashboard → your Aurevia web service → Environment → Environment Variables**, add any of `FINNHUB_API_KEY`, `TWELVE_DATA_API_KEY`, `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`, and `FMP_API_KEY`, then save. Do not use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` names, source files, GitHub variables, or browser code for these credentials. After verifying the provider's plan, market-data licensing, and display rights for your intended use, set `MARKET_DATA_DISPLAY_LICENSES_CONFIRMED=true` to allow the new fallback adapters in production. Leave it false until that review is complete. Saving Render environment settings triggers a service redeploy; no deployment is performed by this repository change.

The authenticated admin provider-status panel tests each configured provider with a real, server-side AAPL quote request. It reports `CONNECTED` only after a successful response, and never returns API key values. It reports `CONFIGURED`, `NOT_CONFIGURED`, `ERROR`, or `LICENSE_REVIEW_REQUIRED` otherwise. A successful test demonstrates authentication and response parsing, not subscription entitlement, licensing approval, or guaranteed ongoing availability.

Provider usage is cached and rate-limited conservatively (Twelve Data: one request per 8 seconds; FMP: one per 12 seconds; Alpha Vantage: one per hour, to stay within its commonly documented 25-request/day free quota). These are per-process limits, not a shared quota coordinator across multiple Render instances. Alpha Vantage and FMP adapters supply daily history only; Twelve Data can provide supported intraday and daily intervals. Provider plans may impose stricter limits, symbol entitlements, attribution, delayed data, or licensing terms. Verify your plan before enabling production usage.
